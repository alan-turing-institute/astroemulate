We're excited to announce the progress on AutoEmulate in this v1.0.0 release -- this release sees the package fully integrated into the PyTorch ecosystem; PyTorch is one of the most popular open-source deep learning frameworks and one of the bedrocks of modern machine learning with Python.

## What's new

### PyTorch refactor and package redesign

AutoEmulate was originally built on top of the scikit-learn framework, which is a great library for traditional machine learning tasks. However, as we moved towards more complex models and larger datasets, we found that we needed the flexibility and performance that PyTorch provides. The new PyTorch backend allows us to leverage GPU acceleration, making training and inference much faster. The PyTorch focus also allows AutoEmulate to integrate with other tools in the broader ecosystem, enabling end-to-end emulation workflows.

### A new set of Emulator models

- Decision about which models to keep, GPs not CNPs etc
- **Ensemble methods**, which give us Uncertainty quantification (2 methods)
- Table of models? Custom implementation vs PyTorch wrapped vs scikit-learn wrapped?
- Processing techniques

### Bayesian model calibration



### Upgraded features

- Simulator in the loop, sub-classing
- Active learning - now a core feature

### Key API changes

As with previous releases, AutoEmulate v1.0.0 can be used to quickly get an emulator from simulation inputs (X) and outputs (y). This now happens in a single step:

```python
    ae = AutoEmulate(X, y)
```

This replaces the previous two-step process of `ae.setup(X, y)` and `ae.compare()`. Check out the [Quick Start Guide](<URL>) for more details on how to use the new API.
