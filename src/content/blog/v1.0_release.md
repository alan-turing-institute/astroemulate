We're excited to announce the progress on AutoEmulate in this v1.0.0 release -- this release sees the package fully integrated into the PyTorch ecosystem; PyTorch is one of the most popular open-source deep learning frameworks and one of the bedrocks of modern machine learning with Python.

## What's new

### Key API changes

### PyTorch refactor and package redesign

AutoEmulate was originally built on top of the scikit-learn framework, which is a great library for traditional machine learning tasks. However, as we moved towards more complex models and larger datasets, we found that we needed the flexibility and performance that PyTorch provides. The new PyTorch backend allows us to leverage GPU acceleration, making training and inference much faster. The PyTorch focus also allows AutoEmulate to integrate with other tools in the broader ecosystem, enabling end-to-end emulation workflows.

### A new set of Emulator models

- Decision about which models to keep, GPs not CNPs etc
- Ensemble methods
- Table of models? Custom implementation vs PyTorch wrapped vs scikit-learn wrapped?
- Processing techniques

### Simulator in the loop

### Active learning

### Uncertainty quantification?
