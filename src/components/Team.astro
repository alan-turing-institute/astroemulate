                <p>
                    Andrew Duncan is Director of Science & Innovation (Fundamental Research
                    in DS and AI) at The Alan Turing Institute. He is a senior lecturer
                    in Statistics at Imperial College London. He obtained a PhD in Applied
                    Mathematics at Warwick before working in Mathematical Modelling at
                    Oxford and then Computational Statistics at Imperial College. Until
                    recently, he held a joint position as Principal/Lead Scientist position
                    at Improbable Defence and Enterprise Insights where he led research
                    initiatives at the intersection of digital twins and AI, with applications
                    to problems in government, national security, energy and logistics
                    and supply chains. Andrew's research has spanned broadly across fundamental
                    data science, machine learning and AI, seeking to leverage theory
                    and tools from probability theory and partial differential equations
                    to answer challenging questions in statistical machine learning and
                    AI. He also has a keen interest in industrial collaboration. Over
                    the last decade, his team has collaborated across a diverse range
                    of UK companies and institutions, working with them to harness principled
                    Stats/ML/AI methods to address their most challenging problems.

                <p>
                    Chris is a researcher focusing on machine learning and generative
                    modeling, particularly interested in integrating concepts from control
                    theory into generative models. His work explores methods informed
                    by energy landscape curvature. He earned his PhD in Computer Science
                    from KTH, Stockholm, where he studied behavior trees and hybrid control
                    systems, with an emphasis on formal stability guarantees for robotic
                    controllers. He is currently a Senior Research Associate at the Alan
                    Turing Institute. His research interests lie at the intersection
                    of generative AI and physical systems.
