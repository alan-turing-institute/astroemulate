                Andrew Duncan is Director of Science & Innovation (Fundamental Research
                in DS and AI) at The Alan Turing Institute. He is a senior lecturer
                in Statistics at Imperial College London. He obtained a PhD in Applied
                Mathematics at Warwick before working in Mathematical Modelling at
                Oxford and then Computational Statistics at Imperial College. Until
                recently, he held a joint position as Principal/Lead Scientist position
                at Improbable Defence and Enterprise Insights where he led research
                initiatives at the intersection of digital twins and AI, with applications
                to problems in government, national security, energy and logistics
                and supply chains. Andrew's research has spanned broadly across fundamental
                data science, machine learning and AI, seeking to leverage theory
                and tools from probability theory and partial differential equations
                to answer challenging questions in statistical machine learning and
                AI. He also has a keen interest in industrial collaboration. Over
                the last decade, his team has collaborated across a diverse range
                of UK companies and institutions, working with them to harness principled
                Stats/ML/AI methods to address their most challenging problems.

                theory into generative models. His work explores methods informed
                by energy landscape curvature. He earned his PhD in Computer Science
                from KTH, Stockholm, where he studied behavior trees and hybrid control
                systems, with an emphasis on formal stability guarantees for robotic
                controllers. He is currently a Senior Research Associate at the Alan
                Turing Institute. His research interests lie at the intersection
                of generative AI and physical systems.
